Charles Hoskinson is a Colorado-based technology entrepreneur and mathematician. He attended Metropolitan State University of Denver and University of Colorado at Boulder to study Analytic Number Theory before moving into cryptography through industry exposure.

His professional experience includes founding three cryptocurrency related start-ups – Invictus Innovations, Ethereum and IOHK – and he has held a variety of colorful positions in the public and private sector. He was the founding chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s education committee and established the Cryptocurrency Research Group in September of 2013.

His current projects focus on education of cryptocurrency, evangelism of decentralization and making cryptographic tools easier to use for the mainstream. This includes leading the research, design and development of Cardano, a third-generation cryptocurrency that launched in September 2017.
